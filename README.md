# Excel
I've been making VBA's occasionally for friends, have been using same code over and over sometimes, so here to share with all


# File Sort
How does this work?
Run the code, select multiple files from dialog and then run it
It looks for files name, matching the name in array
It sorts file in the manner array is numbered
And then performs the calculation
and saves it on desktop

Have added array in numbered form so it's easy for beginners to change the sort manner
Feel free to hit me up, if you need help to customise to your use


#Formatter

Alternate lines are colored
and can add hyperlinks based on row column
